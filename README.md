# odin-recipes

This is my first "Odin Project" mini-project.

The purpose was to demonstrate the ability to:
- Create boilerplate HTML code.
- Create multiple pages linked to the index page.
- Add images with their alternate text.
- Add ordered and unordered lists.

* It was fairly straightforward and easy. 
* I would like to have a better system of commits.
